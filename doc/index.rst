Mixtape -- Statistical models for Biomolecular Dynamics
========================================================

Mixtape is a python package which implements a series of statistical
models for high-dimensional time-series -- the particular focus of the
library is on the analysis of atomistic simulations of biomolecular
dynamics such as protein folding and conformational change. Mixtape is the
"code name" for the next release of `MSMBuilder <http://msmbuilder.org/>`_.


Mixtape is under active development. Many of the algorithms and models
implemented are "mature", but others are rapidly changing.

Algorithms available include:

-  :ref:`cluster`
-  :ref:`msm`
-  :ref:`tica`
-  :ref:`hmm`


Mixtape is developed by primarily by researchers at Stanford University and
Memorial Sloan Kettering, but we welcome contributions. The development all
takes place on `Github <https://github.com/rmcgibbo/mixtape>`_. Mixtape is
licensed under the GNU LGPL (v2.1 or later).
